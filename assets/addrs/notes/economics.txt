we need to change how we buy/sell things
    so that we can adapt to the rise of trx fees...
    and the market of such things...
        bundling should be chain based, but event based

meaning we dont need to change tech to adapt to our behavior
    but adapt our behavior to account for this new currency space
        Make larger commitments on chain...
            decreasing volume, and in turn trx fee

we have to sorta get rid of atomic purchases...
    buying single things as one off events


what about using MaddrStore on basechain
    and then using that to govern another chain
        this other l2 chain can then sacrifice some security
            Like excessive trxs fees because there is trust
    I think this is the only way to go about these things
        because then you can only accept transactions from trusted addresses
        This is how you can limit gas costs
