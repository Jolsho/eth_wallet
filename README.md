This wallet was originally supposed to go on a webserver. Essentially the goal was to offload all the headache of key management away from the client. Eventually I ran into the issue of a user wanting to use different servers that are untrustworthy. It was at that moment I realized the better option would be to do all of this client side. I took parts of this codebase and repurposed in other places, like inside a wasm package. Although this project was largely a miss I learned a lot about key derivation, management, and interacting with ethereum nodes through gRPC.
